# Flex Engine Backlog

### TODO:
- [ ] Add materials in between shaders and objects
- [ ] Make shader system more dynamic (allow for any number/combination of uniforms/vertex attributes automatically)
- [ ] Allow objects to be dynamically created/removed
- [ ] Add object transform tools (at least translation, maybe also rotation & scale?)
- [ ] Save/load level data
