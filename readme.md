# Rendering Engine

This is a rendering engine which supports Vulkan 1.0, OpenGL 4, and Direct3D 11. The goal of this project is to learn about each API and have a test bed for future demos/games.

By supporting three different graphics APIs, I've challenged myself to designed the renderer interface in an API-agnostic way, such that any code calling into the renderer knows nothing about which API is being used.
